<b>Steps to calculate miles walked</b><br><br>

Step 1 - To find the average stride length for a person, multiply their height in inches by 0.413.<br><br>
Step 2 - Step 1 produces the stride length in inches.  Divide that number by 12 to get the average stride length in feet.<br><br>
Step 3 â€“ multiply the result of step 2 by the number of steps to get total feet walked<br><br>
Step 4 - A mile is 5,280 feet.  Divide the result from step 3 by 5,280 to get total miles walked<br><br>
